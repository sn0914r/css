## Inline & Block elements in HTML
1. The elments in HTML are classified into two types:
    1. `Block elements`
        1. This elements take full width and alwys start on a new line.
        2. This elements accepts `width` & `height` properties.
        3. Examples:
            - `div`
            - `p`
            - `h1-h6`
            - `section`
            - `article`, etc

    2. `Inline elements`
        1. This type of elements only take as much width as needed.
        2. This elemnts don't start on next line, instead they stay on same line.
        3. It ignores `width` & `height` props normally.
        4. Examples:
            - `span`
            - `a`
            - `strong`
            - `em`

## display: inline, block & inline-block props in css
1. `display: inline`: this prop allows us to make `block elements behaves as inline elements`.

2. `display: block`: this prop allows us to make `inline elements behaves ad block elements`.

3. `display: inline-block`: it is the hybrid version. It makes the element `stays on the same line` with other elements like inline and `allows width & height` as block element.
