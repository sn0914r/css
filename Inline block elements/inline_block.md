## Inline & Block elements in HTML
The elments in HTML are classified into two types:
### `Block elements`
1. This elements take full width and alwys start on a new line.
2. This elements accepts `width` & `height` properties.
3. Examples:
    - `div`
    - `p`
    - `h1-h6`
    - `section`
    - `article`, etc

### `Inline elements`
1. This type of elements only take as much width as needed.
2. This elemnts don't start on next line, instead they stay on same line.
3. It ignores `width` & `height` props normally.
4. Examples:
    - `span`
    - `a`
    - `strong`
    - `em`

## display: inline, block & inline-block property in css
1. `display: inline`: this prop allows us to make `block elements behaves as inline elements`.
2. `display: block`: this prop allows us to make `inline elements behaves ad block elements`.
3. `display: inline-block`: it is the hybrid version. It makes the element `stays on the same line` with other elements like inline and `allows width & height` as block element.
